## Description

- My motivation came from wanting to make sure I had a good understanding of what makes up the webpage using HTML and CSS and being able to debug, add and comment on what was going on in both HTML and CSS files.
- I worked on this project to go over the source code and make sure everything was in working order and to add bits of code to allow the website to work better if needed. As well as add comments to show what the selectors did in the CSS file.
- The problem that this project solves is having a webpage to go over with the topics of search engine optimization, online reputation management, and social media marketing.
- I learned thaty setting an id tag to an image link will take you to that section in the webpage, going into more detail on the subject.
